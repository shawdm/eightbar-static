		<description><![CDATA[@tennis The aim of using any metaverse Second life or any other is to enable people to engage with one another and with the content. It is still early days, so I guess it depends on what you call mainstream. I know at Wimbledon I got to talk to 200 people a day about wimbledon and what IBM does. Not as pure marketing but as enagaging with interested parties. The website we do for wimbledon has 8.5 million unique users. They are not a like for like comparison. I could not have a dialogue with 8.5 million people.
We are exploring Second Life and othre metaverse technologies. The benefits we have seen just internally of people interacting in an avatar based environment over and above the traditional text and voice ways are leading us to expierment further.
Last year the Australian Open build in Second Life was used exclusively for invite only customers, just as hospitality would be at the actual event. This year the team have opened it up to compare and contrast.
If people want to come along and see the potential they can, and just imagine what it these sort of interactions would be like in 20 years time. Not to replace real life and being there but a step forward from flat TV. Unless we explore these options we wont know what works, what we need to change to make these experiences deeper.]]></description>
